<p>This is a stupid project I did in 2015.  After I got in an argument with friends about movies, I used MATLAB to webscrape data off of IMDB to argue that 80s movies rule.  Then I copy/pasted the .m file into a document, and put the rendered plots into the document to make a psuedo-notebook, like the cool kids who used Mathematica got to play with.</p>

<p>Hereâ€™s what I learned:</p>

<ol>
  <li>I was wrong, so wrong about the 80s being best.</li>
  <li>A friend told me that I was an idiot to use MATLAB for this, and I should really look into this python &amp; Jupyter notebooks stuff.</li>
  <li>Manually configuring a webscraper is damned hard. Dedicated tools like Beautifulsoup are soooo nice!</li>
</ol>

<p>If you want, this stuff has been a repo for ages: https://github.com/jasongfleischer/Were-the-80s-or-the-90s-the-best-decade-for-films-Matlab-based-IMDB-scrapper-</p>
