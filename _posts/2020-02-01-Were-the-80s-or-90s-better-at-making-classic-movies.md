This is a stupid project I did in 2015.  After I got in an argument with friends about movies, I used MATLAB to webscrape data off of IMDB to argue that 80s movies rule.  Then I copy/pasted the .m file into a document, and put the rendered plots into the document to make a psuedo-notebook, like the cool kids who used Mathematica got to play with.

Here's what I learned:

1. I was wrong, so wrong about the 80s being best.
2. A friend told me that I was an idiot to use MATLAB for this, and I should really look into this python & Jupyter notebooks stuff. 
3. Manually configuring a webscraper is damned hard. Dedicated tools like Beautifulsoup are soooo nice!

If you want, the .m/.mat files are [in this Github repo](https://github.com/jasongfleischer/Were-the-80s-or-the-90s-the-best-decade-for-films-Matlab-based-IMDB-scrapper-).

Or just amuse yourself scrolling through the awfulness below:
