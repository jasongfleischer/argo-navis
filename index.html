I create
innovative methods for extracting knowledge from complex
biological datasets. I am particularly interested in
problems where it's not even clear what the correct question to
ask is. I work in collaboration with <a href="https://snl.salk.edu/%7Enavlakha/" >
Saket Navlakha</a> at The Salk Institute, where we
develop new algorithms to understand complex biological
networks, and also study the algorithms solved by natural
systems.

Currently I am exploring changes in gene expression during aging with <a
href="https://hetzer.salk.edu/">Martin Hetzer's lab.</a> In
particular I am interested in understanding if there are
molecular markers that can predict "biological age" as
distinct from chronological age. A method to correctly
predict biological age would be useful in understanding the
aging process, and would have applications in the evaluation
of treatments and in the clinic

In collaboration with <a href="https://panda.salk.edu/">Satchidananda
Panda's lab</a>, I am analyzing
human health data from clinical measures, actiwatches, and
smartphone apps. This combination of data allows us to
investigate relationships between circadian rhythms, sleep
patterns, light exposure, physical activity, and glucose
regulation. A better understanding of the interplay between
circadian and metabolic processes will help us develop
recommendations for a healthy lifestyle and may lead to
treatments for a variety of metabolic disorders.


In my previous
work I addressed questions about neural activity such as:
How are memories formed and
maintained? &nbsp;How are those memories used to generate
flexible behavior as opposed to more rigid conditioned
responses? How do the complex interactions between brain,
body, and environment generate adaptive responses?
