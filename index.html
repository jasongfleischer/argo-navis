	  I create
	  innovative methods for extracting knowledge from complex
	  biological datasets. &nbsp;I am particularly interested in
	  problems where it's not even clear what the correct question to
	  ask is. &nbsp;I work in collaboration with <a
	  href="https://snl.salk.edu/%7Enavlakha/" >
	  Saket Navlakha</a> at The Salk Institute, where we
	  develop&nbsp;new algorithms to understand complex biological
	  networks, and also study the algorithms solved by natural
	  systems.<br>
	  <br>

	  Currently I am exploring changes in gene
	  expression during aging with <a
	  href="https://hetzer.salk.edu/">Martin
	  Hetzer's lab.</a> In
	  particular I am interested in understanding if there are
	  molecular markers that can predict "biological age" as
	  distinct from chronological age. &nbsp;A method to correctly
	  predict biological age would be useful in understanding the
	  aging process, and would have applications in the evaluation
	  of treatments and in the clinic.<br>
	  <br>

	  In collaboration with <a
	  href="https://panda.salk.edu/">Satchidananda
          Panda's lab</a>, I am analyzing
          human health data from clinical measures, actiwatches, and
          smartphone apps. &nbsp;This combination of data allows us to
          investigate relationships between circadian rhythms, sleep
          patterns, light exposure, physical activity, and glucose
          regulation. A better understanding of the interplay between
          circadian and metabolic processes will help us develop
          recommendations for a healthy lifestyle and may lead to
	  treatments for a variety of metabolic disorders.<br>
	  <br>

	  In my previous
	  work I addressed questions about neural activity such as:
	  How are memories formed and
	  maintained? &nbsp;How are those memories used to generate
	  flexible behavior as opposed to more rigid conditioned
	  responses? How do the complex interactions between brain,
	  body, and environment generate adaptive responses? <br> <br>
