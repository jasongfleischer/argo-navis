Currently I am exploring changes in gene expression during aging with
the labs of <a
href="https://hetzer.salk.edu/">Martin Hetzer</a> and <a
href="https://navlakhalab.net/">
Saket Navlakha</a> In
particular I am interested in understanding if there are
molecular markers that can predict "biological age" as
distinct from chronological age. A method to correctly
predict biological age would be useful in understanding the
aging process, and would have applications in the evaluation
of treatments and in the clinic.

In collaboration with the labs of <a href="https://panda.salk.edu/">Satchidananda
Panda</a> and <a
href="http://depts.washington.edu/delaiglesialab/wordpress/">Horacio
de la Iglesia</a>, I am analyzing
human health data from clinical measures, actiwatches, and
smartphone apps. This combination of data allows us to
investigate relationships between circadian rhythms, sleep
patterns, light exposure, behavior, and glucose
regulation. A better understanding of the interplay between
circadian and metabolic processes will help us develop
recommendations for a healthy lifestyle and good public policy.


In previous work I used computational neural models to ask questions such as:  
How are memories formed and
maintained? How are those memories used to generate
flexible behavior as opposed to more rigid conditioned
responses? How do the complex interactions between brain,
body, and environment generate adaptive responses?
