<p>I create
          innovative methods for extracting knowledge from complex
          biological datasets. &nbsp;I am particularly interested in
          problems where it's not even clear what the correct question to
          ask is. &nbsp;I work in collaboration with <a
          href="https://snl.salk.edu/%7Enavlakha/" >
          Saket Navlakha</a> at The Salk Institute, where we
          develop&nbsp;new algorithms to understand complex biological
          networks, and also study the algorithms solved by natural
          systems.<br>

Currently I am exploring changes in gene
expression during aging with <a
          href="https://hetzer.salk.edu/">Martin
          Hetzer's lab.</a> In
          particular I am interested in understanding if there are
          molecular markers that can predict "biological age" as
          distinct from chronological age. &nbsp;A method to correctly
          predict biological age would be useful in understanding the
          aging process, and would have applications in the evaluation
of treatments and in the clinic.<br>
      <br>
In collaboration with <a
          href="https://panda.salk.edu/">Satchidananda
          Panda's lab</a>, I am analyzing
          human health data from clinical measures, actiwatches, and
          smartphone apps. &nbsp;This combination of data allows us to
          investigate relationships between circadian rhythms, sleep
          patterns, light exposure, physical activity, and glucose
          regulation. A better understanding of the interplay between
          circadian and metabolic processes will help us develop
          recommendations for a healthy lifestyle and may lead to
          treatments for a variety of metabolic disorders.<br>
      <br>
In my previous
          work I addressed questions about neural activity such as:
          How are memories formed and
          maintained? &nbsp;How are those memories used to generate
          flexible behavior as opposed to more rigid conditioned
          responses? How do the complex interactions between brain,
          body, and environment generate adaptive responses? <br>
